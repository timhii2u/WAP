SEPARATION OF CONCERNS
1 What is the principle of keeping content separate from presentation, and what are its advantages?

> Keeping content separate from presentation is where the HTML and CSS are declared separately.
> The advantage of doing this is that the styling/outlook/layout of the content can be changed at any time without
    distorting the content(HTML)

2 What are the 3 ways of adding style information to an HTML page?

> inline styling
> using an external cascading style sheet
> embedding the style in the header

3 What is the format of a CSS style rule?  Give an example.

> selector{
    property: value;
  }

    p {
      color: blue;
    }


FONT, TEXT, BACKGROUND
4 How do you set a font type?
>   p {
        font-family: Serif;
    }

>   p {
        font-family: "Times new roman";
    }

    }


5 What are CSS generic fonts and how are they recommended to be used?

> CSS generic fonts are those that every computer has by default.
> They should be added to the end of a list of fonts selected so that if the first declared fonts are not found,
  then the generic font will be used

6 What is the difference between px, pt, and em?

> px are pixes of the screen
> pt are points of screen. where each point is 1/72 of an inch of the screen
> em is the relativity to the current font. e.g 2em means 2*the current font size;
> There are other properties that can be used to state the font size. for example the viewport.
    Viewport is the user's visible area of a webpage.
    stated as vw and vh.
    viewport ensures scalability.
   ***** https://webflow.com/blog/how-and-why-to-use-vh-and-vw-in-webflow *****
    for full length, it is recommended to use vh instead of vw because 100vw does not take into account the scroll width.

  for example; underline, line-through

8 When should you use an <img> versus a background-image?

> use <img> when you want to include an image as an inline element
> use a background-image to set a background on an element.

INHERITANCE AND CASCADING
9 Give an example of a property that is not inherited and why it is not inherited.

> margin; It is not inherited because it would distort the arrangment of the page if it was pushed on to all child elements
  of the embedding element.

10 What does 'cascading' mean in CSS?

> cascading is a how styles are applied, and how conflicting rules do or donot override one another.

11 Why are classes higher scoring than HTML elements and IDs higher than classes?

> Because classes are more specific than HTML elements, Ids are more specif than classes.

SELECTORS
12 What are the HTML class and id attributes?

> Class attributes describe grouped html elements
> Id attributed define unique element within a page

13 Create a jsfiddle that makes hyperlinks yellow after they are visited.

> a:visited{
    color:yellow;
  }

14 What is the difference between div and span?  How does a browser normally align divs and spans?

> A div is a block -level element, it fills up the entire row on a page.
> Span is an inline element, it takes up just the space that it requires.


15 How are divs related to the HTML5 page section tags?

> Divs are generic elements from which sections are created.

16 What are the two CSS context selector syntaxes?  Give examples of each.

>   parent - to all descendants selector
    for example: div.parent p {
                    color: red;
                 }
                 means all paragraphs in div with class parent have a color red.

>  parent - to - direct child selector
    for example: div.parent > p {
                   color: green;
                 }
                means only a paragraph that is a direct child of a div with class parent has color green assigned to it.

A type selector finds elements of a particular type

20 Give an example of grouping type selectors.

> p, span {
    font-size: 20vh;
